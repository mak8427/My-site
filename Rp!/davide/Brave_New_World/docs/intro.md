## The story of 3 Brave ones to chaange the world



## **Chapter I: Ashes of the Old World**

In the twilight of the Lilac Wars, when the fires of ambition still smoldered across Cannor, whispers of a shattered land began to surface once more. Aelantir—once the elven homeland, lost in ash and myth—had been sighted. Not by sailors or scholars, but by fate’s newest playthings: the chosen few.

Summoned under uncertain pretenses to a magical academy, four young aspirants—Andrew, Rune, Eralas, and Lorence—found themselves tangled in threads far older than their lives. Their arrival at a secluded mansion brought no clarity, only riddles. A chaperone appeared, then vanished. A strange moss was grafted to their skin. And in the halls waited Zorian Kazinski—an exile, a mage of frightening power.

Zorian spoke of something coming. He didn’t say what.

By dawn, chaos unfurled. A companion, Andrew, was accused of conspiracy. His panic ignited a fire—both literal and symbolic—and soon the group was thrust into a chain of revelations. Zan held notes, ancient and dangerous, connected to the elven ruins across the sea. The city stirred. The Duke made his announcement. Aelantir was open. Volunteers would be tested—perhaps culled.

Then came the purge.

The plaza erupted. Spells were cast. A tower fell under control. The party vanished, spirited away by Zorian’s magic to the southern reaches of Cannor. There, far from the gaze of the Empire, truth was laid bare: a golem stalks those tied to Aelantir. Powers greater than nations covet the magic buried in its stone. Zorian's organization—the **Volant Circle**—exists to defy them.

And so, the four prepare. Ships are bought. Supplies gathered. Ahead lies exile, danger, and perhaps a new beginning.

Aelantir calls.
