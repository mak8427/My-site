* The session begins aboard the new ship, loaded overnight with supplies from villagers and harbor allies. Arthus,
  despite not being a sailor, commands the ship.
* The Magisterium discovers the groupâ€™s location, forcing an urgent departure.
* Before leaving, Zorian gives the party a crystal connected to Aelantir, possibly linked to the Great Sentient Tree and
  the goddess [Munas Moonsinger](https://anbennar.fandom.com/wiki/Munas_Moonsinger_%28deity%29). Andrew investigates its
  magical communication properties.

### Zorian's Backstory

* Just before departure, Andrew notices they've been discovered, though identities remain unknown.
* The ship sets sail towards Venail, with the group sleeping for nearly a full day afterward.
* Onboard are Small Jonas (annoying but insightful), Swen (skilled, solitary protector), Arthus (piloting), and at least
  fifteen children, including Mathias, who is close to Andrew and "Big Rock" (GuG).

### **We are a Modern Family**

* **Erelas** acts protectively towards the children and patrols the ship for safety.
* **Lowrence** trains his water mimicry magic and gives assertive life lessons to the children.
* **Andrew** entertains the kids and experiments with the Aelantir crystal, identifying its directional magical
  emissions toward Aelantir.

### **Navigation & Location**

* Currently located off the southern coast of Sorncost, the group debates the best route to Venail, ultimately deciding
  to sail northward using favorable wind currents.

  turmoil ahead. ðŸ˜Ÿ

Hereâ€™s your updated **Session 5** summary with all the new elements merged, trimmed for clarity and formatted
consistently:

## **Session 5: Arrival at Venail and Preparations**

* The party lands at the island of **Venail**, where they pay a docking fee and are required to fill out entry
  paperwork. **Erelas**, mistakenly, notes that their destination is **Aelantir**, which could expose their plans.
* The group delivers a letter from **Zorian Kazinski** to **Admiral Thaelon Duskmere**, a low-ranking member of their
  covert organization. He warns them to stay discreet, as Venail is culturally elven and highly suspicious of outsiders.
  Non-Elvish speakers (Elvish = Italiano) may face serious trouble.
* Thaelon offers to help them in the future and agrees to unofficially support their colonial endeavor. While no formal
  pact is signed, an **oral agreement** is made: if the party accepts refugees fleeing conflict and persecution, Thaelon
  will assist with supplies and coordination.
* Thaelon confirms that a **mass migration of Venail's elven population to Aelantir** is planned, though it will take
  time. **Lorent** is also colonizing Aelantir, posing a serious threat to the party's future settlement.
* They learn that their former village, **Ffoggetabbouitt**, was annihilated shortly after their departureâ€”leaving only
  a crater (April 25). This was linked to a massive magical battle involving **Zorian** and archmages from Lorent or the
  Magisterium.
* The clash resulted in **Zorianâ€™s defeat and capture**. The Magisterium blames him for the destruction, which occurred
  in **Necklife**. The incident is viewed by the Emperor of Anbennar as a **Lorentish act of war**, possibly sparking a
  wider conflict.
* The party feels emotionally burdened, especially **Erelas** and **Andrew**, who believe their actions indirectly led
  to the Necklife disaster.
* At the docks, they are referred to **Paul**, a shipwright who can reinforce their vessel. Venail employs woodworking
  mages for such tasks.
* The party also receives a **library pass**. The local librarian, **Paolo**, is unaffiliated with the organization but
  may provide useful materials.
* Lastly, they officially register their intention to sail for Aelantir in port records, unintentionally exposing their
  destination.
