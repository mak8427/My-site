## **Zorian Kazinski – The Runed Exile**

Zorian Kazinski is a half-elf mage of immense talent, originally born in western Dameria. 
His family was wiped out during the final stages of the Lilac Wars, when Lorentish armies sacked his homeland. 
He survived only by instinctively casting his first teleportation spell—an act that marked the beginning of his magical ascent and his exile.

Once a gifted student of the Magisterium, Zorian was excommunicated for delving into forbidden time and spatial magic. 
He became a rogue practitioner, mastering teleportation and showing an uncanny ability to shape raw mana with precision. 
Though secretive and wary of institutions, he has since taken part of a covert organization aiming
to escape the growing tensions in Cannor by establishing a refuge in the newly rediscovered continent of Aelantir.

Powerful, paranoid, and calculating, 
Zorian now leads efforts to protect magically marked individuals like the player characters—believing they are key to the future, 
and to something even darker lurking beneath the surface of the known world.
