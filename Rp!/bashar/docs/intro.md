# Into the Ravener's Hand

This story follows 1000 years after the events of *Mark of the Fool* (one of the greatest magic fantasy novels of all time) and follows the adventures of a party of four individuals: Kaelen Roths, Darwin Sagehorn, Anduril Wallace, and Edmund Wallace.





## Story
Kaelen Roth is busy writing multiple proposals to raise funds for his next experiment. His previous experiments destroyed all his equipment, so his new projects are grander in scope but also more critical, as his degree is at stake.

Kaelen receives a summons from Professor Baelin regarding an expedition to the ruins of a teleportation mage's laboratory. The mage was researching a "portal" spell, aiming to create a more permanent planar gateway. The mission's goal is to recover the mage's notes and any artifacts.

As Kaelen leaves Baelin's office, he notices golden pipes being laid across the university campus but ignores them. The story hints at intrigue and deeper layers to this expedition.
