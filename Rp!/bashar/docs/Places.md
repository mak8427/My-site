## Regions
![Escann](images/Escann_Map.webp)
**Escann** (Old Castanorian for **Eastern Cannor**) is the easternmost region of **Cannor**. It is bordered to its east by the **Serpentspine Mountains**, to its north by **Gerudia**, to its south by **Bulwar**, 
and to its west by **Western Cannor**. **Escann** has historically been divided into three major regions **Inner**, **West**, and **South Castanor**, which are so named due to their having been the domain of **Castanor** and its successor, **Black Castanor**. 
Beginning in the **Age of Witch Kings**, cartographers, politicians and commonfolk alike have reincluded the **Deepwoods** as part of the region after its reintegration at the end of the **Greentide**.

With the final collapse of **Black Castanor** came an end to a fifteen century legacy. Emerging from the chaos and disorder were a number of smaller states stemming from either historical provinces or were founded by veterans of the **War the Sorcerer-King**. 
Such examples are the **Kingdom of Acengard**, a state alleged to have been under the influence of the **Infernal Court**, the **The Genrasi City State** ruled by hero **Alex Roth** who slew the **Sorcerer-King Nichmer**, causing a civil war in the kingdom of Castanor resulting in two warring state named Cast led by the old monerchy and Anor led by the nobility.

During this period, there was a general aversion to direct warfare, an effort to avoid the cataclysms that led to the fall of **Castanor**. Instead, many conflicts were resolved by tournaments, knightly duels and controlled small scale battles. Over the course of this period,
these were codified into what is now known as the **Trial by Chivalry**.

## Countries
### **Corintar**

Founded shortly after **Corin's** death at the **Battle of Castonath**, the **Corintar order** was at first, simply one of many adventuring groups attempting to reclaim **Escann** from **The Greentide**.
With the evangelizing efforts of **Dominic of Gallowspeak** and **Lothane**, **Corintar** became the center first of **Corin's** ascension to the **Regent Court pantheon** and later, 
when **Castellos's** death was revealed during the **Age of Unraveling**, the center of the new **Corinite faith**.

## Cities


### **Oldhaven**

Located near the **Gate of Escann**, Oldhaven is a city of ancient origins now burdened by the challenges of war and survival. It is ruled by **Duke Marlowe Greystone**, whose authority is confined to the city and its immediate surroundings. Despite his limited power, Duke Greystone's leadership is critical as Oldhaven faces a growing influx of refugees fleeing orc invasions, compounding an already dire food shortage.

The city is divided into three distinct districts:

- **Highspire Quarter**: Home to **Skyward Keep**, the Duke's seat of power, and the **Oldhaven Academy of Tactics and Lore**, preserving the traditions of Escann.
- **Riversmeet**: A bustling commercial hub along the **Alderflow River**, now overwhelmed by overcrowding and scarcity of resources.
- **The Hollow**: A historic and shadowy district known for its artisans and rumors of hidden cults.

Despite its struggles, Oldhaven remains the host of the famed **Trial by Chivalry Tournaments**, held in the **Plains of Valor** just outside its walls. These tournaments offer fleeting unity and hope in a city grappling with the effects of the ongoing **war between Cast and Anor**.


### **Generasi**

The city of **Generasi** has developed significantly over the last **1000 years**. While still familiar in some ways—with landmarks,
like the **Roth bakeries** and the **university**—you'll now find that the entire city has been teleported to the top of the **Kargloth** a mountain in the **Serpent Spine**.
