Duke Marlowe Greystone, once a squire during the **War of the Sorcerer-King**, rose to power unexpectedly after Duke Harland Greystone, his distant cousin, named him heir following the tragic deaths of his own children during the Orc Wars.

Marlowe took the title during one of Oldhaven's darkest periods, with refugees flooding the city and the **war between Cast and Anor** isolating it from potential allies. His pragmatic leadership has focused on forging alliances with mercenaries and nearby towns, as well as reopening the **Oldhaven Academy of Tactics and Lore**, emphasizing strategy and cooperation for survival.

However, his reliance on strict rationing and mercenary forces has drawn criticism from the nobility, while his neutrality in the **Cast-Anor conflict** fuels rumors of hidden loyalties. Despite these challenges, Marlowe remains committed to keeping Oldhaven a sanctuary amidst the chaos.
